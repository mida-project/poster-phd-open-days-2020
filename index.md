This repository comes with the set of important information for the poster presented at the [PhD Open Days 2020 (POD'2020)](http://phdopendays.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) event. This poster *template* is based on our early results of the "**[BreastScreening: On the Use of Multi-Modality in Medical Imaging Diagnosis](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3399715.3399744)**" [DOI: [10.1145/3399715.3399744](https://doi.org/10.1145/3399715.3399744)] paper. The work is published on the [POD'2020](http://phdopendays.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) event. The [POD'2020](http://phdopendays.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) is a [Portuguese](https://www.portugal.gov.pt) event taking place physically and remotely from 26th to 28th October 2020 at [Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) in [Lisbon](https://www.lisboa.pt/). The event is a major opportunity for more than one thousand PhD students to socialize and share their research with the rest of the academic community, companies, and alumni. Students are invited to interact and discuss the impact and the relevance of their work in society, opening new avenues for future collaborations, designing future projects, and exploring career opportunities. The general template can be found on the [`template/`](template/) directory. We used the [PPTX](https://docs.fileformat.com/presentation/pptx/#:~:text=Files%20with%20PPTX%20extension%20are,open%20XML%20presentation%20file%20format.) format, with the popular [Microsoft PowerPoint](https://www.microsoft.com/en/microsoft-365/powerpoint) application.
